Title: Setting up permissions for configuring metadata tables - Amazon Simple Storage Service

The S3 Metadata feature is in preview release for Amazon S3 and is subject to change.
To create a metadata table configuration, you must have the necessary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
      permissions to both create and manage your metadata table configuration and to create and
      manage your metadata table and the table bucket where your metadata table is stored. 
To create and manage your metadata table configuration, you must have these permissions: 
s3:CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration â This permission allows
          you to create a metadata table configuration for your general purpose bucket.
s3:GetBucketMetadataTableConfiguration â This permission allows
          you to retrieve information about your metadata table configuration.
s3:DeleteBucketMetadataTableConfiguration â This permission allows
          you to delete your metadata table configuration.
To create and work with tables and table buckets, you must have certain
        s3tables permissions. At a minimum, to create a metadata table configuration,
      you must have the following s3tables permissions: 
s3tables:CreateNamespace â This permission allows you to create a
          namespace in a table bucket. Metadata tables use the default aws_s3_metadata
          namespace.
s3tables:GetTable â This permission allows you to retrieve
          information about your metadata table.
s3tables:CreateTable â This permission allows you to create your
          metadata table.
s3tables:PutTablePolicy â This permission allows you to add or
          update your metadata table policy.
For detailed information about all table and table bucket permissions, see Access
        management for S3 Tables.
If you also want to integrate your table bucket with AWS analytics services so that you 
        can query your metadata table, you need additional permissions. For more information, see 
        
          Integrating Amazon S3 Tables with AWS analytics services.
To create and work with metadata tables and table buckets, you can use the following
      example policy. In this policy, the general purpose bucket that you're applying the metadata
      table configuration to is referred to as amzn-s3-demo-source-bucket. The table
      bucket where you're storing your metadata table is referred to as
        amzn-s3-demo-bucket. To use this policy, replace these bucket names and the
          user input placeholders with your own information:

Title: Joining custom metadata with S3 metadata tables - Amazon Simple Storage Service

The S3 Metadata feature is in preview release for Amazon S3 and is subject to change.
You can analyze data across your S3 managed metadata tables and customer (self-managed)
    metadata tables. By using a standard SQL JOIN operator, you can query data from
    these
    multiple
    sources.
The following example SQL query finds matching records between an S3 managed metadata table
        (my_s3_metadata_table) and a self-managed metadata
    table (my_self_managed_metadata_table). The query also
    filters informations based on CREATE events, which indicate that a new object (or a
    new version of the object) was written to the bucket. (For more information, see the S3 Metadata tables schema.)

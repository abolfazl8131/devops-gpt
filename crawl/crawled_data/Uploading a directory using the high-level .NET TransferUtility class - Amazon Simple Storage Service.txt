Title: Uploading a directory using the high-level .NET TransferUtility class - Amazon Simple Storage Service

You can use the TransferUtility class to upload an entire directory. By
      default, the API uploads only the files at the root of the specified directory. You can,
      however, specify recursively uploading files in all of the sub directories. 
To select files in the specified directory based on filtering criteria, specify
      filtering expressions. For example, to upload only the PDF files from a directory,
      specify the "*.pdf" filter expression. 
When uploading files from a directory, you don't specify the key names for the
      resulting objects. Amazon S3 constructs the key names using the original file path. For
      example, assume that you have a directory called c:\myfolder with the
      following structure:
When you upload this directory, Amazon S3 uses the following key names:
The following C# example uploads a directory to an Amazon S3 bucket. It shows how to
        use various TransferUtility.UploadDirectory overloads to upload the
        directory. Each successive call to upload replaces the previous upload. For
        information about setting up and running the code examples, see Getting Started
          with the AWS SDK for .NET in the AWS SDK for .NET Developer
            Guide.

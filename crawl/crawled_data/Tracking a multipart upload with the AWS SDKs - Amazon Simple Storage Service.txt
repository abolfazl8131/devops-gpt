Title: Tracking a multipart upload with the AWS SDKs - Amazon Simple Storage Service

You can track an object's upload progress to Amazon S3 with a listen interface. The high-level
        multipart upload API provides such a listen interface, called ProgressListener.
        Progress events occur periodically and notify the listener that bytes have been transferred.
        For more general information about multipart uploads, see Uploading and copying objects using multipart upload in Amazon S3.
For an end-to-end procedure on uploading an object with multipart upload with an additional checksum, see 
      Tutorial: Upload an object through multipart upload and
            verify its data integrity.
The following section show how to track a multipart upload with the AWS SDKs.
The following Java code uploads a file and uses the ProgressListener
                        to track the upload progress. For instructions on how to create and test a
                        working sample, see Getting
                            Started in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide.
                    
The following C# example uploads a file to an S3 bucket using the
                TransferUtility class, and tracks the progress of the upload. For
                information about setting up and running the code examples, see Getting Started
                    with the AWS SDK for .NET in the AWS SDK for .NET Developer
                        Guide.
